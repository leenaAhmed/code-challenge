## Lexical Scope in JavaScript 
 
**Lexical scope** refers to the way JavaScript determines variable accessibility based on where functions and variables are declared in the code, rather than where or how they are called during execution.

### Key Points

**Scope Determination at Write Time :** 
 - Lexical scope is set when writing the code, not executing it. This means that variable accessibility is based on the code’s structure.
  
**Accessing Variables in Nested Scopes:**
 - Functions have access to variables in their own scope as well as any variables declared in their outer (or enclosing) scope, known as their lexical environment.
  JavaScript functions “inherit” the scope in which they are written, meaning that inner functions can access variables from their outer functions.

**Static vs. Dynamic Scope:**
 - JavaScript uses lexical (or static) scoping, meaning that a function’s variable access is based on the physical code structure, rather than the calling context.
   
**Lexical Scope Enables Closures:**
 - Lexical scope allows functions to “remember” variables in their outer environment even after the outer function has been completed. This property enables closures, where an inner function retains access to variables from its containing (outer) function.

## Closures 
 
Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows a function to access variables from its outer (enclosing) function, 
even after the outer function has finished execution. This is possible due to the static scoping (lexical scoping) mechanism in JavaScript.

### How Closures Work :

When a function is defined inside another function, it retains a reference to its lexical environment, including all variables 
in the outer scope. This inner function, along with its reference to the surrounding state, is what we call a "closure".

## Key Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**:
        Closures retain the entire lexical environment, including variables and functions, even if they are no longer needed. 
        This can lead to increased memory usage, especially in long-lived or recursive functions. Be cautious to avoid memory 
        leaks by managing closures responsibly and releasing unneeded references.

2. **Minimize Shared Mutable State**:
        Closures that share mutable states can introduce unexpected bugs and make code harder to reason about. 
        Whenever possible, strive to keep the state immutable, or avoid sharing mutable states within closures.

3. **Variable Lifetime**:
        Closures extend the lifetime of variables referenced within the inner function. Variables can outlive their intended scope, 
        which may lead to bugs if not managed carefully. Always be aware of variable lifetimes in your closures to ensure expected behavior.

## Use Cases for Closures: 


1. **Data Encapsulation**:
        Closures enable encapsulating data by providing controlled access through functions and hiding implementation details. 
        This supports building modular and reusable code, which can be particularly useful in larger applications.


        ```
        function createCounter() {
            let count = 0;
            return function() {
                return ++count;
            };
        }
        const counter = createCounter();
        console.log(counter()); // 1
        console.log(counter()); // 2
        ```

2. **Function Factories**:
        Closures allow you to create specialized functions based on a shared template, with each function having its own private state.
        This is useful for generating variations of functions with similar behavior.

        Example:
        ```
        function multiplier(factor) {
            return function(number) {
                return number * factor;
            };
        }
        const double = multiplier(2);
        const triple = multiplier(3);
        console.log(double(5)); // 10
        console.log(triple(5)); // 15
        ```

4. **Event Handlers**:
        Closures are widely used in event-driven programming to preserve the context of an event handler and maintain access to relevant data.

        Example:
        ```javascript
        function setupButton(name) {
            document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
                alert("Hello, " + name);
            });
        }
        setupButton("Alice"); // "Hello, Alice" when button is clicked
        ```


Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows for 
    - *encapsulating data*, 
    - *creating specialized functions*, 
    - *maintaining state across function calls.*
    However, be mindful of memory usage and shared mutable state to avoid bugs and potential memory leaks.
